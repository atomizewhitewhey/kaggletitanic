The introduction for data science competitions in Kaggle. 

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, 
the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the
international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, 
such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, an analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive has to be completed.
In particular, through applying the tools of machine learning, we have to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Most of the analysis was done on the .py file and submitted for evaluation, and managed to score top 13% (856th out of 6940 places)
